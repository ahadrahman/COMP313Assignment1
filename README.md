Demo Video can be found [here](https://github.com/ahadrahman/COMP313Assignment1/blob/master/COMP313%20Demo.mp4)


### Game Description
Flappy Cube, is a remake of the original Flappy Bird. Built using the Unreal Game engine, Flappy Cube has a futuristic look and feel, yet feeling familiar and right at home.

Like the original Flappy Bird, Flappy Cube is a side scroller, but rather than 2D, is in 2.5D. The main action in the game is to make your way through the obstacles as the player glides through the level.

The most difficult part of Unreal was the steep learning curve. Coming from a programming background of typing out code, using the blueprint nodes was not a smooth transition. I initially found myself looking at one tutorial and following the author, but realised I wasn't learning anything and was simply copying. The best way I found learning was watching a bunch of video tutorials covering the fundamentals of Unreal, and how it's all structured. This is because I come from a programming background, so I know the logic I want the game to follow. I just didn't know how to translate the ideas into my head into the blueprints. Talking to my peers and showing each other how we did an aspect of our game (e.g adding sounds) was also a useful way to learn Unreal.

The most interesting part of this development process was the vast amount of options Unreal has. A Flappy Bird remake was my original idea because I wanted to recreate a simple game. But it seems Unreal has many prebuilt templates to help you get started with complex games easily. I found it very interesting exploring the options and customisability Unreal offers, and am excited to dive deeper into this.

### Assignment Checklist (for marker)
